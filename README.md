# MovieDatabase

In this project, I worked with a movie database originally based on the “dvdrental” dataset. It was adapted and implemented in MySQL to practice fundamental SQL concepts. The project focused on retrieving specific information from the database, such as listing movies by rating category or displaying complete customer details.

This hands-on practice has been essential in strengthening my SQL knowledge during my learning journey. It has also prepared me to work effectively in professional environments while continuously improving my technical skills.
